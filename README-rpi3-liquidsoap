How to Install OP25 and LiquidSoap on a Raspberry Pi3 Raspbian Stretch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
These high level instructions will lead you through installing op25 and liquidsoap
on any Debian based Linux system.  It is geared towards the Raspberry Pi3B which is
inexpensive but yet just powerful enough to receive, decode and stream P25 trunked
radio system utilizing either Phase 1 or Phase 2 audio codecs.

It is possible to configure and use op25 with other streaming software (such as Darkice)
but this setup has the advantage of completely avoiding use of the ALSA sound subsystem
with has proven itself to be someway quirky and prone to problems particularly when using
the loopback driver (aloop).

There are many refinements which should be made to these instructions, particularly how
to configure liquidsoap and op25 to properly auto-start at boot time.

  

1. Install op25
---------------
sudo apt-get install git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/boatbod/op25
cd op25
./install.sh 

2. Install GNUPlot-X11 (optional)
-----------------------
sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11

3. Install liquidsoap
---------------------
sudo apt-get install liquidsoap liquidsoap-plugin-all

4. Install PulseAudio (optional, but preferred over alsa for local audio)
---------------------
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils

5. Install Icecase (optional)
-----------------------------
sudo apt-get install icecast2
Follow prompts and set up appropriate passwords
Edit /etc/icecast/icecast.xml and define your mount point(s):
sudo vi /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml
    <!-- You may have multiple <listener> elements -->
    <listen-socket>
        <port>8000</port>
        <shoutcast-mount>/op25</shoutcast-mount>
    </listen-socket>


5. Configure op25
-----------------
Set up rx.py command line options, trunk.tsv, meta.json and other files necessary to
make a working instance of op25. Edit op25.liq to configure local sound options and/or
streaming to icecast server.

6. Run op25 and liquidsoap
--------------------------
Terminal #1:
cd ~/op25/op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps
./rx.py --nocrypt --args "rtl=0" --gains 'lna:36' -S 57600 -q 0 -d 0 -v 1 -2 -T trunk.tsv -V -w -M meta.json 2> stderr.2

Terminal #2:
cd ~/op25/op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps
./op25.liq

Terminal #3: (optional log window)
cd ~/op25/op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps
tail -f stderr.2
