Forked from git://git.osmocom.org/op25 "max" branch on 9/10/2017
Up to date with "max" branch as of 11/19/2017

Many changes:
- udp python audio server sockaudio.py and remote player audio.py
- udp c++ library code updates op25_udp.h, op25_udp.cc
- improved audio buffer handling in sockaudio.py
- wireshark fixes (experimental)
- ability to configure NAC 0x000 in trunk.tsv and have system use first NAC decoded
- fixes for compiling on Debian Stretch
- integrated N8UR logging changes to trunking.py
- ability to adjust fine tuning in real time (,./<> keys in terminal) 
- ability to dynamically resize the curses terminal
- ability to dunamically turn plots on and off from the terminal (keys 1-5)
- new 'mixer' output plot (terminal key 5) to assist with fine tuning
- reworked trunking hold/release logic that improves Phase 1 audio on some systems
- decoding and logging of encryption sync info ("ESS") at log level 10 (-v 10)
- ability to silence the playing of encrypted audio

New command line options:
  --fine-tune      : sub-ppm tuning adjustment
  --wireshark-port : facilitates multiple instances of rx.py
  --udp-player     : enable built-in audio player
  --nocrypt        : silence encrypted audio

NOTE: using the --nocrypt command line option will silence encrypted audio, but the trunking logic will cause the application to remain on the active tgid until the transmission ends.  It is generally preferable to blacklist tgids that are always encrypted rather than simply silence them.  Use the --nocrypt functionality to silence occasional encrypted transmissions on mixed use tgids.
